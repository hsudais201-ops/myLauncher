# myLauncher

A personal Minecraft: Java Edition launcher build for Android, customized for low-memory devices.

**Runtime engine:** [Amethyst-Android](https://github.com/AngelAuraMC/Amethyst-Android). This repository stores the myLauncher build customization and automation. It does not reimplement a Java virtual machine, OpenGL/LWJGL, account sign-in, game downloads, and mod loaders from scratch; those core runtime features come from the upstream open-source engine.

## Device target

- Android 9 (API 28) and newer. Upstream Amethyst declares a lower minimum Android SDK, so this build does not raise it.
- Intended for testing on devices with 2 GB RAM or less; performance is not guaranteed and varies with CPU, GPU, renderer, version, and free memory.
- Built-in low-memory defaults: for devices reporting at most 2,048 MB total RAM, the allocator uses the conservative upstream tiers (296 MB below 1,024 MB, 448 MB below 1,536 MB, and 656 MB from 1,536–2,048 MB). The default resolution scaler targets a 480-pixel short screen edge for that RAM tier when the physical edge is larger than 480 pixels; scaling is rounded upward to the next supported 5% step. Saved preferences still take priority, so users can change the values afterward.
- Suggested Minecraft settings: use 1.8.9 or 1.12.2, render distance 4–6 chunks, Fast graphics, and no shaders. Set these in Minecraft; this project does not force in-game settings.

## Account support and interface

- The launcher retains Amethyst's Microsoft account sign-in and local/offline profile flow. The custom patch removes the online-account gate in the account selector and the local-login screen, so a local profile can be created without first adding a Microsoft account. The local username field is configured as a username field.
- An offline profile is only a local player name; it is **not** a Microsoft-authenticated Minecraft account. Servers requiring authenticated/online-mode accounts may reject it. Do not use offline mode to impersonate another player.
- Local profiles can browse their game directory. Some upstream utilities, including the JAR installer, retain the upstream online-account requirement; this customization does not remove those separate restrictions.
- The launcher home screen gets a lightweight myLauncher title/subtitle header plus a dedicated **Add account** shortcut in portrait and landscape. The shortcut opens the existing Microsoft/local account selector.
- The Android launcher icon is replaced by a lightweight vector mark matching the new dark/purple identity. No UI library or significant runtime dependency is added.

## Build the APK

1. Open the Actions tab in this GitHub repository.
2. Run **Build myLauncher APK** using **Run workflow**, or push a change to `main`.
3. Open the completed workflow run and download its **myLauncher-debug-apk** artifact.
4. Transfer the APK to Android, install it, and allow installation from your download source if Android asks.

The workflow fetches the exact Amethyst commit `330c6eae3164df64bdc4828e946a9e62cc5169e4` and its submodules, rewrites SSH-style public GitHub submodule URLs to HTTPS for hosted runners, validates submodule checkout status, validates the customization regression suite before installing the Android toolchain, applies the customizations, and builds the debug APK. The source pin is independent of branch movement. Update the pin deliberately when adopting a newer upstream version.

## Files

- `.gitignore` — excludes local upstream checkouts, Python caches, and build outputs.
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` — repeatable Android build workflow.
- `.github/scripts/customize_amethyst.py` — deterministic patch for app branding, package/authority IDs, low-memory defaults, offline account access, launcher header, account shortcut, and vector app icon.
- `.github/scripts/test_customizer.py` — regression tests for branding, account access, both launcher layouts, XML well-formedness, missing-anchor failures, and repeat-run idempotency.

## Local build

From this repository's root on Linux, use Python 3, Git, JDK 21, Android SDK command-line tools, platform `android-37`, and NDK `27.3.13750724`. First run the regression suite:

    python3 -m unittest discover -s .github/scripts -p 'test_*.py' -v

Then fetch the pinned upstream source and build:

    git init upstream
    git -C upstream remote add origin https://github.com/AngelAuraMC/Amethyst-Android.git
    git -C upstream fetch --depth 1 origin 330c6eae3164df64bdc4828e946a9e62cc5169e4
    git -C upstream checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD
    git -C upstream submodule update --init --recursive
    sdkmanager --install 'platforms;android-37' 'ndk;27.3.13750724'
    python3 .github/scripts/customize_amethyst.py upstream
    cd upstream
    ./gradlew :jre_lwjgl3glfw:build :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug

## Verification and limitations

The regression tests validate the patching logic when executed. Recent GitHub Actions runs have failed before a runner was assigned (the job has no runner ID and no steps), so those runs have **not** tested the build script or compiled the APK. Check repository Actions availability and the account's Actions usage/billing settings if that persists. GitHub Actions additionally compiles the app when a workflow run succeeds. A successful build is not proof of a real-device gameplay test: Microsoft sign-in, asset downloads, rendering, heat, memory pressure, and FPS still need checking on the target device.

## Upstream and licensing

This project builds and customizes [AngelAuraMC/Amethyst-Android](https://github.com/AngelAuraMC/Amethyst-Android), which is based on PojavLauncher. Retain and follow the upstream license and notices when building or redistributing the APK. This repository provides the customization script so changes can be reviewed and reproduced.
